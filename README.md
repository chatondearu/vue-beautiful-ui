# Vue beautiful UI (bUI)

> A beautiful toolkit of components for UI made with Vue.js

## Why this project

I love VueJs and I love UI, no more ! So on my way I have seen a lot of great packages for UI like the most popular Angular Material, Bootstrap Js, Sementic UI, etc... I don't know why but I think I want use another package for each time I used them.
Its why I decide to make the beautifull toolkit, in first for me with the big possibilty to add all components I want to use (fork this project if you want, it`s free), in second time maybe you want use it too.
Specialy I want to inprove this Toolkit with different possibilitise of design and with a logical UI/UX religion.

## In Progress
